## Project Overview

In this mini-project, our team has worked on BER Performance analysis of linear block codes. We have implemented various coding schemes and analyzed their performance using Python. The goal of this project was to evaluate the Bit Error Rate (BER) under different noise conditions and coding techniques. Our approach involved simulating the transmission of encoded data over a noisy channel and measuring the BER for each coding scheme.

We hope this project will contribute to a better understanding of error correction techniques and their practical applications in communication systems.
